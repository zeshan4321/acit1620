        <h2><i>Introduction</i></h2>
        <p>  I was born and raised in Vancouver, and it’s where I’ve spent most of my life so far. I’m currently working on building
             my skills and experiences after completing a Diploma in General Studies from Langara College. I was in the military for the 
             last 8 years stationed in Shilo, Manitoba. I was deployed overseas to Latvia, and got to travel a lot to the US for training. 
             I like flying drones, which is something I really enjoy. I play Hockey whenever I can because it’s a fun way to stay active, and
             and I like eating pizza.

        <h2><i>Hobbies</i></h2>
        <p>  I’ve always been into video games, and it’s one of my favorite ways to unwind and have fun. I spend a lot of time playing
             Fortnite, Call of Duty, and GTA 5, and I really enjoy getting lost in the action or teaming up with friends online.
             Whether it’s exploring open worlds or competing in matches, gaming has been a hobby I’ve stuck with for years.
             It’s a great way to take a break, and I always look forward to diving into new challenges and adventures in my
             favorite games.

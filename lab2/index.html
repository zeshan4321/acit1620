      <h2>HTML</h2>

      <p>
        At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be
        applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document
        (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?),
        structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three
        columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as
        images and videos into a page.
      </p>

      <p>Elements consist of:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A tag name</li>
        <li>A required or optional attributes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It can be easier to understand what is going on in your code if you have
        it nicely formatted. In this HTML each nested element is indented by
        four spaces more than the one it is sitting inside. It is up to you to
        choose the style of formatting (how many spaces for each level of
        indentation, for example). In Visual Studio Code, you can automatically
        format your code by following these steps:
      </p>

        In Visual Studio Code, you can automatically format your code by
        following these steps:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Type ctrl-shift-p (windows) or cmd-shift-p (mac) to open the Command
          Palette
        </li>
        <li>In the Command Palette, type format</li>
        <li>From the results, choose Format Document</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>
        CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users.
        It can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for
        changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to
        create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a
        layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information.
        It can even be used for effects such as animation.
      </p>

      <p>
        CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups
        of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of
        elements on your web page.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be
        shown as large red text. The following code shows a very simple CSS rule
        that would achieve the styling described above:
      </p>
    </section>
  </body>
</html>
